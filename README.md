Steganography Project

Overview

This project is a Python-based steganography tool that enables users to securely hide and extract messages within digital images. It ensures confidentiality through encryption and password protection, making it a reliable solution for secure data exchange.

Features

Hide Messages: Embed secret messages within images without altering their appearance.

Extract Messages: Retrieve hidden messages from encoded images using the correct password.

Password Protection: Ensures only authorized users can decode hidden messages.

User-Friendly Interface: Command-line script for easy encoding and decoding of messages.

Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed before running the scripts:

Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2 module)

To install OpenCV, run:

pip install opencv-python

Installation

Clone this repository using:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/steganography-project.git
cd steganography-project

Usage

Encoding a Message

Run the encoding script to hide a message inside an image:

python3 stegno.py

Follow the prompts to select an image, enter a message, and set a password.

Decoding a Message

Run the decoding script to extract a hidden message:

python3 decode_script.py

Provide the encoded image and the correct password to reveal the hidden message.

End Users

This tool is beneficial for:

Cybersecurity Enthusiasts: Secure data hiding techniques.

Journalists & Whistleblowers: Protecting sensitive communication.

Researchers & Students: Learning steganography and cryptography concepts.

Conclusion
