Steganography Project

Overview

This project is a Python-based steganography tool that enables users to securely hide and extract messages within digital images. It ensures confidentiality through encryption and password protection, making it a reliable solution for secure data exchange.

Features

Hide Messages: Embed secret messages within images without altering their appearance.
Extract Messages: Retrieve hidden messages from encoded images using the correct password.
Password Protection: Ensures only authorized users can decode hidden messages.
User-Friendly Interface: Command-line script for easy encoding and decoding of messages.

Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed before running the scripts:
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2 module)

To install OpenCV, run:
pip install opencv-python

Installation

Clone this repository using:
git clone https://github.com/vaibhav0x44/Stegno-Project-AICTE.git

cd steganography-project

Usage

Encoding a Message
Run the encoding script to hide a message inside an image:
python3 stegno.py

Follow the prompts to select an image, enter a message, and set a password.

Decoding a Message (RunTime)

Run the decoding script to extract a hidden message:
python3 decode_script.py
Provide the encoded image and the correct password to reveal the hidden message.
